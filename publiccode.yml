    shortDescription: jEAP Spring Boot DB Migration Starter is a Spring Boot starter for running DB migrations as separate jobs (i.e. on Kubernetes/OpenShift).
    longDescription: >
      The jeap-spring-boot-db-migration-starter provides a standardized way to run
      database migrations in jEAP-based applications during deployments on Kubernetes-based platforms.
      It leverages Flyway for schema migration and supports running the migration as
      a dedicated Kubernetes job (init container) or in traditional startup mode.
      During deployments, the migration job runs before the application pod starts,
      ensuring that the database schema is ready before the service goes live. For
      local development, migrations can be executed directly during application
      startup. The starter offers configuration options for migration mode, schema
      location, and initialization behavior, allowing teams to adapt it to various
      deployment environments while ensuring safe and consistent schema evolution.
    features:
      - Executes Flyway migrations as a Helm deployment job or during application startup
